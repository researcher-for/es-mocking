## Command Line Clients
There are two Command Line Clients available. One written in NodeJS which provides a simple user-friendly interface:

https://github.com/genome-nexus/genome-nexus-cli

There is also a Java Command Line Client which has been developed with a focus on internal processes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center but might work for your use case as well:

https://github.com/genome-nexus/genome-nexus-annotation-pipeline

They are similar in terms of feature completeness

## Other Languages

The API follows the Swagger/Open API specification, so clients can be generated in most languages: https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators
