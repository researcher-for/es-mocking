# Tools ðŸ“Š
The Genome Nexus API powers several visualizations in [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org), for instance:

- the online [Mutation Mapper Tool](https://www.cbioportal.org/mutation_mapper), which uses Genome Nexus to annotate mutations supplied in MAF format and draw a lollipop plot
- Several annotations displayed in the mutation tables column of cBioPortal, e.g. on the [Patient View Page](https://www.cbioportal.org/patient?studyId=lgg_ucsf_2014&caseId=P04)

For more information about the Genome Nexus and cBioPortal integration see the [cBioPortal docs](https://docs.cbioportal.org/2.1-deployment/architecture-overview#genome-nexus)

Note that Command Line Clients for annotating MAF and VCF are describe in the [API](API.md) section
