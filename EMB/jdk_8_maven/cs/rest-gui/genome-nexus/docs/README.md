# Genome Nexus Documentation ðŸ§¬

Welcome to the documentation for Genome Nexus! Genome Nexus is a comprehensive
one-stop resource for fast, automated and high-throughput annotation and
interpretation of genetic variants in cancer. Genome Nexus integrates
information from a variety of existing resources, including databases that
convert DNA changes to protein changes, predict the functional effects of
protein mutations, and contain information about mutation frequencies, gene
function, variant effects, and clinical actionability.
