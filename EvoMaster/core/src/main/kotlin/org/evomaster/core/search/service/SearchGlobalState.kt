 * Global state used in the search.
 * Each gene should be able to access this shared, global state.
 *
 * Implementation detail: this is not implemented as static state singleton,
 * due to all issues related to such design pattern.
 * It is not injected with Guice either, due to how we sample and clone individuals,
 * which are not injectable services.
 *
 * This instance is created only once per search (using Guice), and added manually
 * each time an individual is sampled and cloned.
